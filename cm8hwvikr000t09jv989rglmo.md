# Overview

When developing Android apps, it's easy to overlook the fact that the APK installed via Android Studio is specific to your device. While Android Studio provides an option to manually generate an APK for distribution, sharing it with others can be cumbersomeâ€”especially for personal projects or portfolio apps that you want to showcase alongside your GitHub repository.

Web developers can conveniently share their hosted projects via a simple link in their README or sidebar. But for Android developers, the process of manually generating an APK, uploading it to GitHub Releases, and writing release notes every time you update your project can be tedious and time-consuming.

What if I told you this entire process could be automated? Imagine just pushing your code to GitHub, and everything elseâ€”APK generation, release creation, and release notesâ€”happens automatically.

In this article, weâ€™ll explore how to achieve this using **GitHub Actions**, a built-in automation tool within GitHub. No additional tools are requiredâ€”just pure automation.

Let's get started! ðŸš€

# What is Github Actions?

GitHub Actions is a **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) platform** that enables you to automate your software development workflowsâ€”right from your GitHub repository. With GitHub Actions, you can automate tasks such as building, testing, and deploying your code without relying on external CI/CD tools.

It provides **full-fledged virtual machines** where you can run virtually any automation script, making it highly flexible and easily integrable with various tools and services. Whether you need to build an APK, deploy a website, or run scheduled tasks, GitHub Actions allows you to streamline your workflow efficiently.

# Setting Up Your Workflow

Workflows are automation scripts that allow us to define and execute specific tasks automatically. In GitHub, these workflows are stored inside a special folder called `.github/workflows` at the root level of your repository.

Workflows are written in **YAML**, a widely used language for CI/CD pipelines. In this section, weâ€™ll create a workflow file to automate the APK generation process.

## Creating the Workflow File

To get started, create a new file named `build.yml` inside the `.github/workflows` folder of your repository.

## Overview of the Workflow File

```yaml
# Name of the workflow
name: Build APK

# Triggers
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

# Permissions for this workflow
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  packages: write

# Task jobs
jobs:
  setup:
    name: Setup
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

  build:
    name: Build APK
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: setup
    steps:

  create-release:
    name: Create Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [setup, build]
    steps:
```

This workflow is configured to run on two triggers:

* **Push to the** `main` branch
    
* **Manual trigger (**`workflow_dispatch`)
    

If youâ€™re unfamiliar with these configurations, donâ€™t worry! The key part to focus on is the `jobs` section. These jobs define the different tasks that will be executed on a virtual machine (in this case, `ubuntu-latest`). We will use artifacts to share the context of one job to the next one

Each job consists of **steps**, where we write Linux terminal commands to perform specific tasks.

## **Defining Task Jobs**

To automate the APK generation and release process, weâ€™ll define three jobs:

### **1\. Setup**

* Generates required secret files inside the workflow (such as `google-services.json` for Firebase).
    

### **2\. Build**

* Compiles and builds the APK using Gradle.
    
* We use the **debug** version in this example, but you can configure it to generate a **release** version as well.
    

### **3\. Create Release**

* Generates release notes.
    
* Uploads the generated APK to **GitHub Releases** automatically.
    

By structuring our workflow this way, we ensure a smooth and automated process for generating, managing, and publishing APK filesâ€”without manual intervention! ðŸš€

# **Configuring Secrets for Secure Builds**

To keep sensitive information safe, GitHub provides a way to store secrets securely within your repository. These secrets can then be accessed within your workflows without exposing them in your code.

### **Adding Secrets to Your Repository**

1. **Navigate to your repository settings:**
    
    * Go to **Settings â†’ Secrets and Variables â†’ Actions**.
        
        ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1742424215837/66a0ac95-030a-4caf-916a-bdc4b6fec75f.png align="center")
        
2. **Create a new secret:**
    
    * Under **Repository Secrets**, click **New repository secret**.
        
    * Enter a **name** for the secret (e.g., `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON`).
        
    * Paste the content of your secret (e.g., the entire `google-services.json` file) into the **Value** field.
        
    * Click **Add secret**.
        
3. **Repeat for other secrets:**
    
    * You can store API keys, authentication tokens, or any other sensitive data using the same process.
        
    * Give each secret a meaningful name, as weâ€™ll refer to them later in the workflow.
        

### **Accessing Secrets in the Workflow**

Once secrets are stored, they can be accessed inside the workflow using the following syntax:

```yaml
${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}
```

For example, to use the `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON` secret inside a GitHub Actions workflow, you can write:

```yaml
- name: Create google-services.json
  run: |
    mkdir -p app
    echo '${{ secrets.GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON }}' > app/google-services.json
```

This ensures your secrets are securely injected into the build process without being hardcoded in your repository. ðŸš€

# **Setup and Build APK with Gradle**

## **Setup Job**

The `setup` job is responsible for preparing the environment, generating necessary configuration files, and handling secrets securely.

```yaml
setup:
    name: Setup
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      short_sha: ${{ steps.sha.outputs.sha }}
    steps:
      - name: Create google-services.json
        run: |
          mkdir -p app
          echo '${{ secrets.GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON }}' > app/google-services.json

      - name: Create secrets.xml
        run: |
          mkdir -p app/src/main/res/values
          cat << EOF > app/src/main/res/values/secrets.xml
          <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
          <resources>
              <string name="fcm_server_key">${{ secrets.FCM_SERVER_KEY }}</string>
          </resources>
          EOF

      - name: Get short SHA
        id: sha
        run: echo "sha=${GITHUB_SHA::7}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - name: Upload config files
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: config-files
          path: |
            app/google-services.json
            app/src/main/res/values/secrets.xml
          retention-days: 1
```

This job ensures that all required secret files and metadata are created within the GitHub worker before the build process begins. You can add more secrets as needed, making this job the central place for managing them dynamically.

## **Setting Up Java and Gradle in GitHub Actions**

Before building the APK, we need to set up Java and Gradle in the GitHub Actions environment.

```yaml
build:
    name: Build APK
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: setup
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up JDK
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          distribution: 'oracle'
          java-version: '17'
          cache: gradle

      - name: Download config files
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: config-files
          path: ./app

      - name: Change Gradle Wrapper Permissions
        run: chmod +x gradlew
```

This step ensures that the environment is ready with the correct Java version and Gradle configuration.

## **Running the Gradle Build Process**

Once the environment is set up, we can proceed with building the APK using Gradle.

```yaml
      - name: Build with Gradle
        run: ./gradlew assembleDebug
```

> To ensure that the generated APK can be accessed in the next job, we upload it as an artifact.

```yaml
      - name: Upload APK
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: app-debug
          path: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
          retention-days: 1
```

This ensures that the APK is stored temporarily and can be used in subsequent jobs, such as creating a GitHub release.

# **Automating GitHub Releases**

Once the APK is built, the next step is to automate the release process on GitHub. This includes dynamically generating version tags, uploading the APK as a release asset, and automatically generating release notes.

## **Generating Version Tags Dynamically**

To track versions effectively, we generate a new tag based on the latest commit.

```yaml
- name: Get Last Tag
  id: get_last_tag
  run: |
    git fetch --tags
    LAST_TAG=$(git describe --abbrev=0 --tags || echo "none")
    echo "last_tag=${LAST_TAG}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

- name: Generate New Tag
  id: generate_new_tag
  run: |
    echo "new_tag=1.0-${GITHUB_SHA::7}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

> This retrieves the last version tag (if any) and generates a new tag based on the latest commit SHA.

## **Uploading the APK to a GitHub Release and Generating Release Notes**

After generating the APK, we create a GitHub release, attach the APK, and automatically generate release notes.

```yaml
- name: Create Release
  id: create_release
  uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  with:
    tag_name: ${{ steps.generate_new_tag.outputs.new_tag }}
    name: "Release ${{ steps.generate_new_tag.outputs.new_tag }}"
    body: |
      ## What's Changed
      **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/compare/${{ steps.get_last_tag.outputs.last_tag }}...${{ steps.generate_new_tag.outputs.new_tag }}
    draft: false
    prerelease: false
    files: |
      app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s happening:

* **Tagging the release** with the newly generated version.
    
* **Attaching the APK file** to the release.
    
* **Generating a changelog** using GitHubâ€™s comparison link between the last release and the new one.
    

> If you want more detailed release notes, you can integrate an LLM API to generate a summary of changes dynamically.

# **Enhancing the Workflow**

## **Signing the APK for Production**

For production builds, the APK must be signed before uploading to Google Play. To do this, store your keystore file as a GitHub secret (Base64 encoded) and use the following steps in your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Decode Keystore
  run: |
    echo "${{ secrets.ANDROID_KEYSTORE }}" | base64 --decode > app/keystore.jks

- name: Sign APK
  run: |
    jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA256withRSA -digestalg SHA-256 \
    -keystore app/keystore.jks -storepass ${{ secrets.KEYSTORE_PASSWORD }} \
    app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk my-key-alias
```

> This will sign the APK using the keystore stored in GitHub Secrets.

## **Uploading the APK to Google Play (Optional)**

If you want to automate the deployment to Google Play, you can use **Google Play Developer API** along with the `r0adkll/upload-google-play` GitHub Action.

```yaml
- name: Upload to Google Play
  uses: r0adkll/upload-google-play@v1
  with:
    serviceAccountJson: ${{ secrets.PLAY_STORE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT }}
    packageName: com.example.app
    releaseFiles: app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
    track: production
    status: completed
```

> This will upload the signed APK directly to Google Playâ€™s internal testing or production track.
